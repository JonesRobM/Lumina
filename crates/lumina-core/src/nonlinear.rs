//! Nonlinear optical response (SHG/THG).
//!
//! **Status: Stub for future implementation.**
//!
//! For materials with broken inversion symmetry, the second-order nonlinear
//! dipole moment at frequency $2\omega$ is driven by the local field:
//!
//! $$
//! \mathbf{p}_i(2\omega) = \epsilon_0 \chi^{(2)}_{ijk} : \mathbf{E}_{\text{loc},j}(\omega) \mathbf{E}_{\text{loc},k}(\omega)
//! $$
//!
//! The far-field radiation is then computed by re-solving the CDA system at
//! the harmonic frequency with these nonlinear sources.

// This module is intentionally left as a stub.
// Implementation is planned for post-v0.1.
